# Basic-Portfolio

This is my first homework. I have decided to complete recommended one; therefore, I created three HTML pages that are linked to one CSS page. Also, I added additional CSS page named reset.css. I copied reset styles here: https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/

Also, I used images in this homework. First image is my photo, and second image was used as a background and obtained here: https://www.toptal.com/designers/subtlepatterns/

For my portfolio page, I used  five images that were downloaded from Google images. They looked nicer than placeholders. I will update them down the road if needed.

Technologies used:
CSS
HTML
GitLab
GitHub

The most challenging part was creating the very first page: About Me (index.html). After I figured out layouts of this page, the other two was much easier to create. I only had to change content of my div class="container"

Here are schrrenshots of index.html and contcat.html code:
